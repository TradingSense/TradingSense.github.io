                <h3>What is TradingSense?</h3>
				<p>TradingSense provides trading signals and stock market information to investors. Using machine learning, we forecast the price of the most popular stocks and backtest these forecasts to ensure we are providing the most accurate information to investors. Money flow index and williams percent range are incorporated into our machine learning software to determine the best trading move for investors. Our backtests indicate our forecasts are on average, 90% accurate.</p>
				<p> --- </p>
				<p>TradingSense began as a twitter bot that automatically tracked the price fluctuations of top stocks. At first, even support of stocks was limited. Eventually, all stocks became supported and trackable. The idea of "Predicting" stock prices became intruiging and brought on the idea of using Machine Learning to recognize and forecast the trend patterns of stocks using years of past data. Due to the volatility of the stock market, it is impossible to predict its exaxt movements. However, we were able to predict the prices of stocks with 80-95% accuracy on a regular basis. The accuracy of a prediction can also be forecasted, by backtesting predictions with the real price outcome an average accruacy can be given to give users a sense of how accurate the most recent prediction is.
