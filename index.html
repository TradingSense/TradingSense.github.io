In order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover).The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).

When Is Debt A Problem?

Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price.</p>

How To Calculate Return On Equity?

Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷Shareholders' Equity

So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Zoetis is:

45% = US$2.3b ÷ US$5.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).

And Its 45% ROE

Zoetis clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.30.</p>

SOURCE Elliott Investment Management L.P.Responses From Investment Community, Current and Former Employees and Industry Experts Overwhelmingly Support the Need for Change

Highlights Widespread Lack of Confidence in Company's Strategy, Current Management and Board

Reiterates Need for a Robust Review of Fiber Business, CEO Change and a Reconstitution of the Company's Board

Full Letter Available at RestoringTheCastle.com

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla., Dec. 7, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Elliott Investment Management L.P. ("Elliott"), which manages funds that collectively have an investment of approximately $2 billion in Crown Castle Inc. ("Crown Castle" or the "Company"), today sent a letter to Crown Castle's Board (the "Board") summarizing the feedback received since publicly sharing its views on the Company last week.The full text of the letter follows:

December 7, 2023

Board of Directors

Crown Castle Inc.

8020 Katy Freeway

Houston, TX 77024

Dear Members of the Board:

We are writing to you again on behalf of Elliott Associates, L.P. and Elliott International, L.P. (together, "Elliott" or "we").Best regards,

Jesse Cohn

Managing Partner

Jason Genrich

Senior Portfolio Manager

About Elliott

Elliott Investment Management L.P. (together with its affiliates, "Elliott") manages approximately $59.2 billion of assets as of June 30, 2023.That underperformance has now expanded to 85%, translating into $26 billion of unfulfilled value.6 Yet this Board has remained unwilling to make the right decision and change course, leaving us and other investors wondering:

Having been warned three years ago that the Fiber strategy was the road to value destruction, and having watched that destruction take place and done nothing, how much more value destruction will this Board permit before finally taking action and changing the leadership of Crown Castle?

Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$19b

After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage.Key Insights

Using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Atlassian fair value estimate is US$279

Atlassian's US$195 share price signals that it might be 30% undervalued

Analyst price target for TEAM is US$213 which is 24% below our fair value estimate

Does the December share price for Atlassian Corporation (NASDAQ:TEAM) reflect what it's really worth?A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:

	<p style='text-align:left;margin:0px;'>If you adjust fiscal 2024 free cash flow down by $200 million to make it more comparable with fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2026 on an underlying basis, the stacking of multiyear contracts build annually will mechanically generate significant free cash flow growth in fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2026.The progression from the adjusted fiscal 2024 free cash flow base, will be a bit more linear, although fiscal 2026 free cash flow growth is expected to be faster than fiscal 2025 as our largest renewal cohort converts to annual billings in that year.

In the near term, the new transaction model results in a shift from contra revenue to operating costs that provide a tailwind to revenue growth, while being broadly neutral to operating profit and free cash flow dollars and mechanically result in percent operating margins taking a step or two backwards.

By product in constant currency, AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT revenue grew 7%, AEC revenue grew 20%, manufacturing revenue grew 9% and in double-digits, excluding variances and upfront revenue, and M&E revenue was down 4% and up high single-digits percent, excluding variances in upfront revenue.

And second, the transition to annual billings means that about $200 million of free cash flow in Q1 fiscal 2024 that came from multiyear contracts built upfront will not recur in fiscal 2025.As Andrew said, our new transaction model will likely provide a tailwind to revenue growth be broadly neutral to operating profit and free cash flow dollars and be a headwind to operating margin percent.And we still anticipate fiscal 2024 will be the free cash flow trough during our transition from upfront to annual billings for multiyear contracts.

Time and again, well-executed transformation from desktop to cloud from perpetual license and maintenance to subscription has added new growth factors, built a more diverse and resilient business, forged broader trusted and more durable partnerships with more customers and given Autodesk a longer run rate of growth and free cash flow generation.Free cash flow was $13 million in the third quarter, primarily limited by the transition from upfront to annual billings for multiyear contracts and the payment of federal taxes we discussed earlier this year.

First, the macroeconomic drag on new subscriber growth, a smaller EBA renewal cohort with less upfront revenue mix, and the absence of EBA true-up payments are headwinds to revenue growth in fiscal 2025.The comments I've made in previous quarters regarding the fiscal 2024 EBA cohort, foreign exchange movements, and the impact of the switch from upfront annual billings for most multiyear customers are still applicable.

Overall, we expect first half, second half free cash flow linearity in fiscal 2025 to be more normal than in fiscal 2024.</p>

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues.Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.

This includes our Southeast Gateway project in mid-2025, expected to contribute approximately $800 million in incremental annual comparable EBITDA, along with an additional $3 billion of assets on our U.S. Natural gas pipelines business, some of which include Gillis Access Extension, Virginia Reliability, and Wisconsin Reliability projects.Year-to-date, we have placed approximately $5 billion of projects into service, including capacity projects in our natural gas and liquids pipeline businesses.As Francois mentioned, given our strong year-to-date performance, we now expect our 2023 comparable EBITDA, to be at the upper end of the 5% to 7% outlook, compared to 2022.

This includes accelerating the timing, of certain maintenance and growth capital expenditures, to optimize efficiencies and mitigate project execution risk, in our natural gas pipelines businesses, as well as the foreign exchange impact of a stronger U.S. dollar.

So far this year we've placed approximately $5 billion of assets into service, including the majority of our West Path project that went into service on November 1.As a result, year-to-date comparable EBITDA of $1.1 billion from the liquids business was up approximately 8% versus the same time last year.While our natural gas pipeline's businesses do not carry any material volumetric or price risk, strong utilization rates do demonstrate the demand for our services and the criticality of our assets.

The assets in our system are critical to meeting customers' needs, and we are seeing additional demand, for incremental service that reflects the competitive nature of the corridor.

Same theme in the U.S. LNG deliveries averaged 3.1 Bcf a year - year-to-date in 2023, about a 1.5% increase compared to last year's third quarter.During the third quarter, we continue to deliver strong performance leading to a 7% year-over-year increase in comparable EBITDA.</p>

About Sharesource Data

Baxter’s Sharesource RPM platform is the first two-way, digital health solution that enables healthcare professionals to stay connected with their home dialysis patients.About HDx Therapy Data

The Theranova dialyzer was designed to deliver HDx therapy, which filters a wider range of molecules from the blood than traditional hemodialysis (HD) filters by targeting efficient removal of large-middle molecules,3,4,5,6 allowing for filtration closer to that of the natural kidney.7,8 Many of these large-middle molecules have been linked to the development of inflammation, cardiovascular disease, and other comorbidities in dialysis patients.3,4,5,9

This evidence supplements earlier studies indicating Sharesource may reduce hospitalization rates by up to 39% and hospitalization days by up to 54%,1 and is associated with a significant increase in time patients stay on therapy, by 3.2 months over the first two years.2 The remote patient management platform—which currently supports more than 63,000 PD patients globally and has helped deliver more than 66 million treatments in 85 countries—allows healthcare providers to securely view their patients’ recently completed home dialysis-related treatment data that is automatically collected after each PD session.</p>

Strengths

Market Leadership in Title Insurance: Fidelity National Financial Inc's title segment, which includes leading underwriters such as Fidelity National Title Insurance Company and Chicago Title Insurance Company, collectively issues more title insurance policies than any other company in the United States.Such financial robustness enables FNF to pursue strategic acquisitions like TitlePoint, which not only diversify its service offerings but also position the company for long-term growth in the real estate technology sector.

The recent acquisition of TitlePoint, a leader in real estate property research technology, for $224 million in cash, not only enhances FNF's service capabilities but also demonstrates its financial strength and strategic growth initiatives.

Relationship benefits for home lending products aim to make homeownership more attainable

In addition to discounted rates on personal loans, Key's expanded relationship benefits include a 0.25% interest rate discount on new KeyBank mortgages, Home Equity loans or Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOC)4 when clients have a KeyBank checking account with five or more qualifying transactions each month, or when they sign up for automatic payments from a KeyBank account.Home Lending: To receive relationship benefits on a new KeyBank mortgage loan, which provides a 0.25% interest rate reduction, you must have owned a Relationship Account (as defined and required in the above Relationship Benefits footnote) at any time during the mortgage loan application process, but no later than seven (7) business days prior to the closing of the mortgage loan.In addition to relationship benefits on eligible savings and credit card accounts, starting November 15, relationship clients receive a 0.50% interest rate discount on new loans, including Personal (Debt Consolidation), Auto, Motorcycle, RV, Boat, and Unsecured Home Improvement loans.3 With total U.S. household debt rising to over $17 trillion in the second quarter of 2023, Key's reduced interest rates can offer relationship clients more flexibility as they work toward their financial goals.For adjustable-rate mortgages ("ARMs"), the 0.25% interest rate reduction will apply to the initial fixed interest rate period and will be reflected in the maximum amount the interest rate can increase over the term of the loan, subject to the minimum interest rate that may be charged per the terms of the Promissory Note or Agreement.

For KeyBank Home Lending accounts, to receive relationship benefits on a new KeyBank mortgage loan, which provides a 0.25% interest rate reduction, you must have owned a Relationship Account (as defined and required above) at any time during the mortgage loan application process, but no later than seven (7) business days prior to the closing of the mortgage loan.For KeyBank interest bearing checking, money market savings and Cashback Credit Card accounts, application of relationship benefits will be determine based upon whether you have met the Qualifying Transaction requirements of the Relationship Account portion of the Bank with Key criteria for the current calendar month based on the Qualifying Transaction activity in your Relationship Account during the prior calendar month.As an alternative to the relationship benefit, you may obtain a 0.25% interest rate reduction if you complete and submit, no later than seven (7) business days prior to the closing of the mortgage loan, the Monthly Automatic Payment form to have your recurring mortgage payment for your KeyBank mortgage loan automatically deducted from an "Eligible KeyBank Consumer Checking Account" (as defined in the above (Relationship Benefits) footnote).If you close all of your Relationship Account(s) or your Plus 1 Account you will no longer meet the Bank with Key criteria and will not receive a Grace Month, meaning you will lose relationship benefits starting the calendar month immediately following the month in which you closed your Relationship Account(s) or your Plus 1 Account, unless otherwise stated.

Strengths

Brand Portfolio and Market Position: JM Smucker Co's strength lies in its robust portfolio of leading brands, such as Folgers, Dunkin' coffee, Jif, and Smucker's, which command significant market share in their respective categories.The acquisition of Hostess Brands, expected to close in the third fiscal quarter, is set to introduce a new reportable segment, Sweet Baked Snacks, and rename the U.S. Retail Consumer Foods segment to U.S. Retail Frozen Handheld and Spreads, signaling strategic growth initiatives.

Although the company has managed to navigate through the recall with a net favorable impact, the incident underscores the vulnerability of food manufacturers to product safety issues and the associated financial and reputational risks.

This $0.07 per share decline resulted primarily from the previously mentioned $0.035 per share increase in same-store bad debt, the $0.02 per share decrease in same-store occupancy and the $0.015 per share decline in same-store rents, partially offset by the $0.01 per share in lower property expenses resulting from lower taxes.This 40 basis point increase in bad debt for the third quarter equates to approximately $0.01 per share, and the 60 basis point increase in the fourth quarter equates to approximately $0.015 per share.Turning back to revenue, we had expected same-store bad debt would be 100 basis points for the third quarter, 90 basis points for the fourth quarter and 120 basis points for the full year.This is primarily the result of approximately $0.01 in lower same-store NOI, resulting from $0.035 in decreased revenue, driven by 80 basis points of lower occupancy and 10 basis points of higher bad debt, partially offset by $0.025 in lower property expenses resulting from typical seasonal declines.In conjunction with the increase in bad debt on rental revenues, we also experienced higher bad debt on administrative and other fees of another $0.005 per share for the third quarter, and we are anticipating the same additional $0.005 for fees in the fourth quarter.

We are now anticipating fourth quarter new leases of negative 4.5% and a 4% average increase in renewals for a blend of approximately negative 0.7%, resulting in a decline of approximately $0.015 per share for the fourth quarter.As a result, we have revised our fourth quarter full year guidance to reflect weaker new lease growth, lower occupancy and higher bad debts than we expected even in the summer.

BANNINGS AND BOOK FAIRS

The publishing industry's push to offer more diverse books continued to clash with a surge in bannings and attempted bannings that the American Library Association reports has reached levels not seen in decades, with Toni Morrison's “The Bluest Eye” and John Green's “Looking for Alaska” among those removed from shelves.”

Authors Guild CEO Mary Rasenberger told The Associated Press that she thinks the industry is on the verge of an “explosion" of AI-generated books that could well cut into the earnings of authors, most of whom already make little from their work.

13-Year Low Home Sales in October

In October, previously owned home sales dipped 4.1% from September, hitting a slow annualized rate of 3.79 million units—the lowest since August 2010, contrary to analysts’ expectations.Lawrence Yun, NAR’s chief economist, noted challenges due to low housing inventory and high mortgage rates but mentioned ongoing multiple offers, especially for starter and mid-priced homes, with price concessions more prevalent in the upper market.

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to Q3 2023 BXP Earnings Conference Call.Nicholas Philip Yulico

I was hoping we can maybe get a feel for in terms of the impairments that were down for the JVs, if there's any sense on how much the unlevered asset values may have changed in that impairment analysis?

Michael E. LaBelle

Sure, Nick, this is Mike.Operator, can you please open the lines up for questions?

Question and Answer Session

Operator

(Operator Instructions)Last October, we provided the leasing expectations embedded in our '23 guidance, between 500 million to 1 million square feet per quarter, aka, 750,000 square feet on average or 3 million for 2023.

BXP's regional teams continue to lease space and outperformed the market because our portfolio is fundamentally comprised of premier workplaces, the majority of the demand, new and existing clients in the market want to be in these types of properties, and we're investing capital in our building infrastructures, amenities and client spaces, which allow our teams to meet client needs.

Now moving to private real estate capital markets, U.S. transaction volume for office assets in the third quarter was muted, dropping 48% from the second quarter to $4.4 billion, the lowest quarterly level of office transaction activity, since the first quarter of 2010.

Also for the third quarter, net absorption for the premier segment was a positive 0.5 million square feet, versus a negative 600,000 square feet for the balance of the market.

And I show our next question comes from the line of Jason Wayne from Barclays.

Jason Adam Wayne

You said in your prepared remarks, you don't expect WeWork to exit all of their assets.So what pricing do you think you could issue a 10-year bonds at today?

Michael E. LaBelle

So this is Mike.And can you help us understand how your FAD growth has generally kept pace or outpaced FFO given how office is such a capital-intensive business?

Michael E. LaBelle

Thanks, Camille.A 52,000 square foot multi-floor lease with a private equity firm growing in our portfolio in Manhattan, a 70,000 square foot asset manager growing in our portfolio in Manhattan, and an expansion for a 21,000 square foot private equity firm in D.C.

John P. Kim

Doug, in your prepared remarks, you talked about occupancy basically remaining stable next year despite another year of a very favorable backdrop, 2.7 million square feet expiring, your pipeline is 1.2 million square feet.Story continues

Helen Han

Good morning, and welcome to BXP's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call.I'm just curious, if you can quantify, what kind of IRRs buyers are looking at and kind of where pricing would need to be in order for you to effectuate on any of these potential sales?

Owen David Thomas

Caitlin Burrows

Earlier, you guys talked about how you're opting to repay the $700 million of unsecured debt with mortgages collaterized by Cambridge properties at SOFR plus 225.

What metrics do you think might more accurately reflect the business now, and are the ones that you're monitoring so that we can follow along at home?

Owen David Thomas

I just want to add one thing and then maybe I'll let Hilary comment on this, for New York, which is, there is no question that the overall amount of demand in the market in the -- what I would refer to as sort of the Park Avenue District of New York, which is this area between, call it, 43rd Street and 59th Street, Park Madison, Lexington, a little bit of Fifth Avenue is by far the strongest market from a demand perspective, we're seeing in the country.

240,000 square feet in New York, 100,000 square feet in D.C. and 278,000 square feet in the West Coast market.

Moving to BXP's capital market activity for the third quarter, we completed a restructuring of our investment in Metropolitan Square, a recently renovated 657,000 square foot office building located in Washington, D.C. BXP owned a 20% interest in and provided leasing and management services for the asset, which was encumbered by senior loan of $305 million and a mezzanine loan of $115 million.This meant they would need to pay replacement cost rents and sign a lease now using all the inputs I just outlined, to be in new construction in the Back Bay in 4 years, and there are no 300,000 square foot block of high-rise space available in premier buildings in the Back Bay today.

Entrepreneurial, in many cases, family office buyers attracted by the low per square foot values relative to historical levels, small transaction sizes requiring less capital and likely not involving debt financing, and renovation plans designed to take advantage of future leasing market recovery.

And anything else, any other tenants besides WeWork, that will be a headwind to breaking out of that 88% to 89% occupancy range?

Douglas T. Linde

Yes.And those are really the only large ones other than our joint venture property at 250 -- sorry, Times Square Tower, where O'Melveny & Myers is moving out, about 250,000 square feet, but we've covered already 75,000 to 100,000 square feet of that expiration.

Richard Anderson

In Jamie's logic, maybe I could sneak in 3 questions, since I'm last.

So the space that we have available at Embarcadero Center and what I just described at Folsom Street in our 535 market, as well as some of the availability that we now have because of lease terminations in Seattle and Madison Center and at Colorado Center in West L.A.

Those are really the sort of bigger blocks of space that we have in terms of overall volumes that will drive an outsized opportunity for growth, as opposed to where we are now, which is we're sort of treading water at this sort of 88% to 89% level.Douglas T. Linde

4 if you want.

Many of these assets are not in a position to commit capital to existing or new tenants, which greatly impacts the leasing brokers interest in considering them for their clients and offers us for the opportunity to further increase our market share.

When there is that demand, we will sequentially start to think about how we might be attractive to tenants that are looking for buildings where the economics would justify the new construction of the life science relative to where the market economics are.

3 Hudson Boulevard is a 1.8 million square foot building, whereas 343 Madison is currently still in the design process, but let's just call it, 850,000 to 900,000 square foot building.

Hilary?

Hilary J. Spann

Thanks, Doug.Rod?

Rodney C. Diehl

Yes.Including 2 buildings undergoing renovation, 94% of BXP's CBD space is in buildings rated by CBRE as premier workplaces, which has been important in driving the increasing office attendance statistics in our buildings, and is a critical differentiator for BXP in the leasing marketplace.

Today, I'll cover BXP's operating outperformance in the third quarter, key economic and market trends impacting our company, and BXP's capital allocation activities for the quarter.

From a broad market perspective, the office supply picture didn't really improve much in the third quarter with almost every market continuing to experience net negative absorption, manhattan being the one place, where there was some positive.

In Boston, there were 3 completed office transactions, all under $100 million of reasonably well-leased assets that sold for $290 to $690 a square foot and 6.7% to 7.5% cap rates.

Well, so I think this is part of something that's been confusing in the marketplace because generally, when you have a recession, company's earnings are down and they lease less space, and that's what -- it's how cycles have traditionally operated for office companies, because leasing slows down, when you have a recession.

But I just don't think, I think our general view at the moment is, all of the negative perspective out there on office is, in our view at least irrationally spilling over into premier workplaces, which will create opportunities for BXP.

Platform 16 was clearly the biggest one by far, because if you start looking at the kind of discounting the cash flows for a land development deal until you're actually going to build it, the discount rate that you would use on a development rate, which is pretty high, has a significant impact on the value.

If you're the CEO of a company, and your lease is coming up or you're thinking about your space requirement, your decisions about that are going to be very contingent upon what you think the future prospects of your business are, and many businesses are negatively impacted by rising rates and some of the uncertainty in the economic environment.

And as you start to see the job listings start to perk up a bit, and you start to see hiring announcements by many of the larger technology companies and some of the financial institutions, which do, in fact, broadly talk about those things, you will clearly see a more, I would say, conducive environment for office leasing on a going forward basis.

Just looking at the 2 projects, the MTA site would seem to be like the winner just given the focus on Grand Central, Park Avenue, whereas 3 Hudson just seems like a more challenged deal given the economics of trying to lease up that building at the necessary rent given the size of that building.

We had excellent sales growth in our technology and value-added service businesses, driven by the Henry Schein One practice management software sales and by Large Practice Sales, the practice brokerage business we acquired at the close of this quarter.With respect to sales growth in the quarter, I will focus primarily on LCI sales growth, which is internally generated sales in local currencies compared with the prior year and excludes acquisitions.This growth reflects high prior year comparison sales growth and higher sales on lower-priced products, including generics and corporate brands, albeit with higher margins.

This change in guidance primarily reflects lower sales as a result of the cybersecurity incident which, as previously mentioned, is expected to lower full year 2023 percentage sales growth in the low to mid-single digit range.We are updating guidance for 2023 -- our non-GAAP guidance to $4.43 a share to $4.71 a share, reflecting a narrowing of the range of our guidance for 2023 non-GAAP diluted EPS for the underlying business to $5.18 to $5.26 from $5.18 to $5.35 that was previously communicated, reflecting softening macroeconomic conditions and estimated $0.55 to $0.75 per share impact is due to business interruption from the recent cybersecurity incident.

Our 2023 net sales are now expected to be 1% to 3% lower than 2022 net sales, which is an update from prior guidance of 1% to 3% sales growth.Global Medical sales during the third quarter were $1.1 billion and LCI sales decreased 4.6% due to lower sales of PPE products and COVID-19 test kits.Profitability for the quarter benefited from our technology, value-added services and dental specialty products as we continue towards our goal of achieving 40% of operating income from sales of high-growth, high-margin products.Our internal sales growth slowed in the third quarter due to some market softness in September as a result of general macroeconomic weakness as well as lower sales of PPE products at COVID tests.Despite current macroeconomic conditions and the cybersecurity incident, we have confidence in the stability of the dental and medical markets and remain committed to our strategic priorities and long-term financial model, which includes high-single digit to low double-digit growth in operating income.

North American dental merchandise LCI sales decreased 1.2% compared to the prior year and decreased 0.1% when excluding sales of PPE products.</p>

Taking both the mild spring weather of the second quarter and extremely hot summer weather of the third quarter into consideration, we continue to guide to our $4.10 to $4.30 per share earnings guidance range for the year.In fact, the number of residential cooling degree days, which is a utilities measure of the effects of weather, increased more than 28% over the same period a year ago and were 32% higher than historical 10 year averages.

Due to the weaker weather normalized residential sales, we are adjusting our sales growth guidance for the year to 1% to 3% while keeping our long term sales growth guidance at 4.5% to 6.5%.Finally, our customer care center was ranked as the top care center amongst our peers so far through the third quarter of this year as rated by our customers in the J.D. Power electric customer satisfaction study.With the extreme weather that we experienced each summer remains as important as ever to continue assisting our communities through our heat release support programs, APS partners with local community organizations to aid the state's most vulnerable populations.

These are just a few examples of our efforts to collaborate for the benefit of our customers and communities, and I'm pleased to share that APS was recently recognized with the innovative Corporate Philanthropy Award by the Phoenix Business Journal for these partnerships and programs aimed at providing heat relief to vulnerable individuals and customers.

	<p style='text-align:left;margin:0px;'>This will be driven by a few key assumptions, namely: achieving through scale a blended US market share of 2.5% through both acquisitions, channel expansion, market share gains and same store growth improvements in a normalized SAAR environment; second, driving SG&A as a percentage of gross profit to below 60% through increased leverage of our cost structure in a normalized GPU environment and optimizing our network; third, continued maturity and growth of our first adjacency, DFC, achieving profitability in the latter half of 2024; fourth, continuing to expand revenue and consumer optionality with Driveway by attracting 98% new customers through a seamless and transparent one-price experience with seven day return privileges and shipping directly to your home; fifth, GreenCars, educating consumers on sustainable transportation and expanding our penetration levels of electric vehicles; and finally, ongoing return of capital to shareholders through dividends and opportunistic share buybacks.

While the average consumer APR and financed vehicles is up over 200 basis points year-over-year, the average monthly payments remain stable as consumers continue to invest in personal transportation needs at all price levels and incentives continue to accelerate.Our [physical] footprint will soon span over 500 locations worldwide, which combined with the ability to shop, sell and service vehicles wherever, whenever and however customers desire, will create massive benefit as we leverage the size and scale of our network and give customers optionality and experience that they desire.

This result was driven by strength in new vehicle demand and service and parts, offset by the impact of declining new vehicle gross profits with returning supply, higher floor plan interest costs and investments associated with our adjacencies.We hit another milestone as our weighted average APR on loans originated in the quarter hit 10%, up 50 basis points from the prior quarter and 240 basis points over a year ago.Overall, the financing operations segment had an operating loss of $4.4 million for the quarter and losses sit at $43.8 million year-to-date.

Our team is headed towards achieving our revenue goals and margin expansion to have LAD's EPS to revenue ratio producing $1.10 to $1.20 in earnings per share for every $1 billion in revenue and in the longer term, generating $2 in earnings per share.We ended the quarter with net leverage, excluding floor plan and debt related to DFC at 2 times, up a little over a quarter of a turn from the second quarter.The combination of our strategy and experienced teams gives us the confidence in our ability to eclipse $50 billion in revenue and produce a ratio of $1.10 to $1.20 of EPS for every $1 billion of revenue in the midterm and ultimately over $2 long term.For the quarter, we had a 9.7 penetration rate declining from the second quarter, primarily due to our focus on increasing yield rates and to move in line with our top-tier competitors that we benchmark to.

Supported by the education provided by GreenCars, sustainable vehicle sales accounted for 16% of total new vehicle sales in the quarter, up from 10% in Q3 of '22.</p>

	<p style='text-align:left;margin:0px;'>As a reminder, with over 1,400 patients CARDIO-TTRansform is the largest study in this patient population to-date, designed to generate the data physicians and payers want and need to understand the value of eplontersen offers for patients and to enable the best possible treatment decisions for patients.

With these highly positive results we are on track to file for marketing approval in the US and EU early next year positioning olezarsen for its first potential approval as early as the end of next year assuming priority review in the US.

For example, in a study recently conducted by the Hereditary Angioedema Association of over 500 patients with HAE, only 13% of these patients reported having good control of their disease with more than 85% reporting two or more attacks per year.

As anticipated, our operating expenses and operating loss for the third quarter and year-to-date increased over the same period last year as we advanced our commercial readiness activities and our pipeline, especially, our late-stage programs.

Based on its strong overall profile including highly positive Phase 3 data together with the freedom of a simple at-home monthly self-administration profile ,we believe eplontersen is well positioned to become the therapy of choice for ATTR patients who remain underserved by current therapies.

We are on the cusp of delivering our near-term commercial medicines to patients starting with the first potential approval of eplontersen this year.

And today, with one of the most robust late-stage pipelines in the industry, with nine medicines in development for 11 indications, we're turning that promise into new medicines for patients in need and not just one or two, but a steady and growing cadence of new transformational medicines over the mid and long-term.Based on the positive data we reported from the Phase 3 BALANCE study, we believe that olezarsen is poised to become the standard of care for patients with FCS.

Our successes this year which are a direct result of our efforts in these key areas move us closer to achieving our ultimate goal to deliver a steady cadence of new transformational medicines to patients and to generate next-level value for all Iona stakeholders.Among our partner neurology programs we recently completed enrollment in the Phase ½ study of ION582 in patients with Angelman syndrome putting us on track for data around the middle of next year.We have a strong financial foundation substantial recurring R&D revenue, a substantial and sustainable royalty revenue that can continue to grow and we expect to add new product revenue from our advancing and expanding wholly owned pipeline.</p>

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to the Icahn Enterprises L.P. Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call with Jesse Lynn, General Counsel; David Willetts, President and CEO; and Rob Flint, Director of Accounting.

Can you parse out what the returns were in the quarter, if you were to strip out the energy shorts?

David P. Willetts

I can...

Andrew Berg

Was all that decline pretty much the energy short and ex the being short of that position you were actually up in the quarter on everything else?

David P. Willetts

What I don't want to do cavalierly, Andrew, is come up with a precise figure.Any change or you don't want to say because it's in the middle of the quarter?

David P. Willetts

With the energy shorts?

Andrew Berg

Yes.

David P. Willetts

Adjusted EBITDA was $32 million for the quarter, a $31 million improvement as compared to the prior year quarter.

Operator, can you please open the call for questions?

Question and Answer Session

Operator

(Operator Instructions)Does that -- should we still think about the shorts as being broad market, shorts in terms of that net exposure or more single name?

David P. Willetts

We still have broad market hedges.And if it's the latter, can you give us any commentary on what the services adjusted EBITDA was on a stand-alone basis year-over-year?

David P. Willetts

I have to be a little careful.Adjusted EBITDA was $24 million for Q3 '23, compared to $5 million for the prior year quarter.

The Pharma segment's adjusted EBITDA for Q3 '23 improved by $8 million as compared to prior year quarter, mainly due to margin improvement.

Just curious as to where you are in the process of getting to where you would think it will be based upon what you outlined previously last quarter in terms of change in strategy?

David P. Willetts

Thank you for the question.Just trying to understand the support of the dividend and where you see it coming from if we were -- if you were to maintain this on a sustainable basis?

David P. Willetts

The Board looks at all of those factors in several more every quarter.And as you think about your liquidity position here, opportunities to buy back debt in the market versus investment in the fund or what you're seeing opportunistically to utilize the liquidity you have today?

David P. Willetts

Sure.</p>
