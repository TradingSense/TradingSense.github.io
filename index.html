The drinks companies say their products can match the quality of cocktails poured by professional bartenders for a fraction of the price.

Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on British exchanges.

Persistent Challenges

While 2023 was a big improvement over an inventory-constrained 2022, the challenges seen at the end of the year are expected to persist.Kia America said sales fell slightly in December to 60,275 vehicles even though its sales for the year hit a record 782,451.

(Bloomberg) -- General Motors Co., Stellantis NV and other automakers reported slowing US sales growth toward the end of last year while rival Toyota Motor Corp.’s volume remained strong, as near-record sticker prices and high interest rates led to uneven impacts across the auto market.

12 Most Profitable European Stocks

Andrij Vatsyk/Shutterstock.com

Our Methodology

To make our list of the most profitable European stocks, we ranked all European firms trading on the NYSE or NASDAQ by their market capitalization and then ranked the 30 biggest firms with their trailing twelve month net income.

Further details were present in the BOE's monetary policy statement which shared:

The MPC will continue to monitor closely indications of persistent inflationary pressures and resilience in the economy as a whole, including a range of measures of the underlying tightness of labour market conditions, wage growth and services price inflation.Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management is the firm's biggest hedge fund shareholder in our database due to its $488 million investment.

However, unlike the U.S., economic growth in Europe has been more muted, which has raised hopes that the rates might come down sooner as central banks become wary of inflicting permanent damage on the economy.

Jennifer Saibil has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.Before you buy stock in Carnival Corp., consider this:

The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Carnival Corp. wasn't one of them.Carnival should also be buoyed by the Federal Reserve's forecast for interest rate cuts, as lower interest rates would potentially allow it to refinance some debt at a lower rate and lower its payments on its variable-rate debt.

While it hasn't gotten the attention that AI stocks have received, Carnival stock was up 131% by late December as business rebounded from the pandemic and is seeing record levels of demand.

The Key Takeaway

We'd say the price-to-sales ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.

It appears that shareholders are confident in the company's future revenues, which is propping up the P/S. Unless the analysts have really missed the mark, these strong revenue forecasts should keep the share price buoyant.

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues.Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.

By Rod Nickel, Ana Mano and Sourasis Bose

SAO PAULO, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Brazil's drought is causing farmers there to delay fertilizer purchases for their upcoming corn-planting season, denting sales for global fertilizer suppliers in the world's top corn-exporting country, executives told Reuters.

Brazil's soybean harvest is already delayed and that hold-up may push back planting for the main corn season that follows it early next year, which is likely to affect fertilizer companies like Nutrien, Mosaic and Yara.</p>

Presentation

Operator

Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Mettler-Toledo Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call.And then I think as we kind of particularly look at the fourth quarter, I think this year's fourth quarter is setting up to be a more unusual fourth quarter for the group in terms of like a lack of that end of year uptick that we normally see in terms of market demand and we can't predict what Q4 of next year is going to be like, but I wouldn't expect it to be the same environment that we're faced right now.

Can you maybe talk about that in sort of the context for '24 Europe and on the core industrial side?

Patrick K. Kaltenbach

I'll start with it and -- on Europe, yes, we have seen actually good performance this year in the end markets, but [EMEA] also had some easier comparisons versus China, U.S. compared to last year, where they had -- we had seen more growth last year in the market.I think the one topic we have in Q4, Josh, is that kind of like -- if you look at how we think about market demand in the fourth quarter, I don't think we're going to get -- I think market demand is going to be less than it normally is towards the end of the year.But then as we kind of like enter the year, we're very much thinking not to get too specific this early, but we're definitely thinking the first half of the year is going to probably look more similar to the second half of this year.Operator, I'd like -- I'd now like to open the line for questions.

Question and Answer Session

(Operator Instructions)Participants

Adam Uhlman

Patrick K. Kaltenbach; President & CEO; Mettler-Toledo International Inc.

Shawn P. Vadala; CFO; Mettler-Toledo International Inc.

Catherine Walden Ramsey Schulte; Senior Research Analyst ; Robert W. Baird & Co.We continue to expect our tax rate to be 19% for the full year and again in the fourth quarter.

Fully diluted shares amounted to $21.9 million, which is approximately a 3% decline from the prior year.Do you -- I'm just surprised to hear you say that given what my understanding of how the business is and sort of like how your visibility is for the next couple of quarters, can you just a little bit more confidence on what's sort of going into this other than we like tougher or easier comps in the back half of next year.

We have also provided our initial guidance for 2024, and based on our assessment of market conditions today, we would expect local currency sales to be approximately flattish and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $39.10 to $39.80 which represents a growth rate of 0% to 2% or 2% to 4% growth excluding adverse currency.

Shawn P. Vadala

I was going to say, just to answer your question specifically, for next year, we're a little bit more cautious on Europe and for core industrial, specifically, probably expecting it to be more flattish next year.But we also -- one of the things we have going on next year is we also have -- so if you kind of like think about our overall cost structure, excluding bonus and incentives might be down slightly, but we do have to bring back bonus levels to a more normalized level next year.Secondly, we expect our year-over-year margin performance to be dampened due to lower sales volume and a reset in our variable compensation programs, offset in part by our cost savings initiatives.

I had contact with several key customers out there, and they said, look, we have to hold our budget together this year, and we will continue to look into opportunities next year, but don't expect a big budget flush from us in Q4 this year.While we have cultivated an attractive portfolio opportunity pipeline, the strong growth we expect to deliver this year means we face very challenging growth comparisons in 2024 and therefore, would expect modest revenue declines.

From a geographical perspective, we expect, as I mentioned before, China to be down high single digit with a bigger decrease in the second -- in the first half of the year and growth in the second half of the year.And then for Europe in total for next year since I'm hitting it, we're probably looking at growth up slightly for the year overall.

We expect our local currency sales to improve in the second half of the year as comparisons become easier and market conditions improve.

Remember, we have a very strong sales team in Europe that goes mainly direct but as -- and we leverage our -- also our -- spinning our sales capabilities to direct our sales team to opportunities very quickly and also address hot segments like lithium-ion batteries, et cetera, which help us to compensate some shortfalls in other areas.

In Q3, I think our growth rate, Shawn, correct me if I'm wrong, was 6%, and that for the full year, still holds up in the high single digits and on low double-digit growth for the full year on services.But then when we kind of like think about next year, we're probably more in the 2% range, probably more -- in a more normalized environment for next year.And then again, how much of that is really driven off the year comp dynamic versus underlying demand accelerating?

Shawn P. Vadala

I mean, like I said before, I mean, I think we expect lab for the full year to be up slightly, and then we expect on the industrial side, overall, it's going to be flattish with core industrial down slightly and product inspection up slightly.I think we also appreciate that there was an element of maybe some stocking at customers that were happening with supply chain constraints during COVID, and some of that inventory is also going to be flushed out by the time we get to the second half of next year.

And when you kind of look at the back half of next year versus even like a 2019, you start to see more consistency from what we see here in the second half of this year.In terms of the operating margin, I mentioned flattish, but if you look at the gross margin, I think it will actually be up a little bit next year.

But of course, as we get into the year, we'll refine things as we learn more about trends as we enter the year.

So 4Q seems maybe like a little more of a depressed number than how you think of next year, I guess.

I think you mentioned in the question, our currency will be about a 2% headwind to our EPS kind of next year.

But I guess any risk that, that business starts to slow on the back of softer hardware and maybe pressures growth and profitability as we move into '24?

Patrick K. Kaltenbach

Yes.And should we assume gross margins being consistent flattish year-on-year?

So I think the overall sales growth for the full year next year is flattish.So from a CAGR perspective, we're kind of looking at what we saw in Q3 and how we're guiding Q4 and then just kind of taken a step back and applying our own judgment as to like that looks reasonable to us as kind of a moderation or normalization rate as we kind of think about next year.I mean anything you're seeing like in the markets that you're trying to capture within the guide, suggesting that maybe like fourth quarter is trough and things start to get better as we roll into '24.

Now of course, we're also facing tougher compares because we also had strong growth in the second half of last year.

Just to add data on SternDrive, this year, when I talked about stepping up on our strategic pillars, we just launched SternDrive Wave 3 with a strong focus on automation on the [shop floor], smart automation and we expect it also to continue to significantly contribute to our performance next year and drive savings, both on the automation side, but also back office efficiencies, et cetera.</p>

PIMs “should also be based on objective metrics,” that have been “tracked over time” because new metrics could be distorted by “unique events,” Canavan said.If utilities perform well, “they should expect to earn more than the cost of equity and reward their investors,” but “if they perform poorly, they should expect only the cost of equity, or perhaps less,” LeBel said.

Connecticut’s “legacy business model,” and traditional regulation of utilities are “fundamentally at odds” with today’s technologies, policies, and accelerating adoption of distributed energy resources,” the decision said.“That does not mean zero utility risk” or “insulating utilities from the responsibility to perform at a high level to earn PIMs,” he said.

But the threat to utilities “is not completely clear” because “PBR will only negatively impact the utility if it fails to meet the performance standards,” she added.

A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:

Presentation

Operator

Thank you for holding, and welcome to Alliant Energy's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call.Given a higher for longer rate environment and your increased capital plan announced today, how should we think of the magnitude of rate requests in future cases going forward as compared to historical levels?

John O. Larsen

Yes.Robert J. Durian

Yes, Andrew, I would say, as we've kind of evaluated 2023 and 2024, we are looking for opportunities to continue to kind of time the spend to be able to achieve all of our financial adjectives over the 2 years.

And then given that renewable spending is a little bit lower in the plan, Robert, I think I heard you say that despite that, you still expect pretty good tax transferability, tax credit transferability generation here that the only equity need is around if you get a higher equity ratio at the regulated utilities from your regulated rate cases that are currently underway.

And as we get into '24, we would certainly update that if we're tracking a different part of that range, but think of it as pretty solid for our range in '24.

Dariusz Lozny

Okay.We actually think we'll be averaging probably close to $300 million a year in tax credit monetization proceeds, provides us a lot of flexibility with our financing plans and therefore, does not require any material common equity to be able to finance those capital expenditure plans.

Our forward-looking electric and gas rate review focuses on our plans to strategically invest in a cost-effective and diverse energy mix, coupled with grid modernization to deliver a more reliable, sustainable, resilient and secure energy future for our Iowa customers and communities.

Curious if you can make any comments on efforts towards our prospects for settling that rate case?

Lisa M. Barton

Yes, Dariusz, it's Lisa here.Expected benefits include applying for federal funding, maximizing tax benefits by meeting tax credit added requirements and leveraging new and enhanced opportunities to monetize tax credits, which materially improved our cash flows and credit metrics as well as reduce future financing needs.

and then maybe any longer-term sales growth assumptions?

John O. Larsen

Nathan, this is John here.Robert J. Durian

Yes, we would plan to continue to utilize our share in our direct plan to be able to issue approximately $25 million a year in new common equity.And maybe some thoughts on how much might be sustainable versus one-time?

John O. Larsen

Operator

(Operator Instructions) Ms. Gille, there are no further questions at this time.

Question and Answer Session

Operator

Thank you, Mr. Durian.And as we look at the opportunities to be able to monetize those tax credits, given the volume of tax credits we're generating currently with the wind projects and the solar projects as well as those will be added into our portfolio over the next few years along with battery storage.

Operator

Your next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.

Operator

Your next question comes from Ross Fowler with UBS.

Operator

Your next question comes from Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank.

Operator

Your next question comes from Alex Mortimer with Mizuho Securities.

In Iowa, with an advanced ratemaking ruling in hand for our planned 400 megawatts of solar, we will continue to expand our investments in resilient, clean energy resources for our customers and communities by bringing this new generation online.

Story continues

John O. Larsen

Thank you, Susan.More near term, our plans over the next 14 months include up to $1.9 billion of financing, including up to $1 billion of long-term debt at Alliant Energy Finance, up to $700 million of debt at IPL, approximately $25 million of new common equity through our Shareowner Direct plan, and up to $200 million of new common equity only to supporting the increase authorized by the PSCW for WPL's equity layer.Lisa M. Barton

Thank you.

These metrics, and several others, help BXP earn a Value grade of B, while GLPI has been given a Value grade of D.

BXP stands above GLPI thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that BXP is the superior value option right now.

In addition, the company's remarks include reference to non-GAAP measures.Net effective rates to new customers were down year-over-year 16.9% during the quarter and that gap widened out in October to 18%, reflective of a more aggressive pricing environment.

While difficult to predict timing with any amount of certainty in the current log-jam and single-family home sales is broken through any combination of buyers and sellers coming together on pricing expectations, a relaxation of interest rate policy or a pullback in costs creating an acceleration in the construction of affordable new homes, our portfolio will most certainly experience a rapid acceleration in top line growth, as that pent-up demand creates movement and customers.

Challenging market conditions, reduced consumer spending in light of rising inflation and an elevated interest rate environment have been dampening the demand for the Zacks Retail-Home Furnishings industry.Although an improved housing market scenario, backed by limited existing inventory, is a boon for the industry players, a series of rate hikes, continued investments in e-commerce and higher raw material costs in the home furnishing market are concerns.

	<p style='text-align:left;margin:0px;'>Furthermore, we expect nonresidential volumes in the fourth quarter to be flat to slightly down on a year-over-year basis, similar to what we experienced in the third quarter.

Price contribution to net sales growth was flat in the third quarter, and we expect it to be roughly flat again in the fourth quarter, resulting in low single-digit price contribution for the full year.On a year-over-year basis, net inventory was down about $325 million or roughly 28%, even with higher product costs, inventory acquired through acquisitions and new inventory to support greenfields.

And we believe that our long runway of growth opportunities in underpenetrated geographies and underpenetrated product lines, coupled with our industry-leading capabilities and operational excellence will continue to drive organic above-market growth in the range of 2% to 4% annually.

We’re raising our expectation for adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $890 million to $910 million due to our margin performance in the third quarter as well as confidence in our ability to better sustain margins through the end of the year.

From a margin perspective, we anticipate further margin normalization that wasn’t fully realized this year to impact our results in the first half of fiscal 2024, while we continue to drive our margin initiatives to offset these impacts.

We believe that our profitable growth, agile business model, and focus on efficiency will continue to generate strong operating cash flow at a rate of 60% to 70% of adjusted EBITDA, underpinned by a strong balance sheet to provide robust capital deployment.

Gross margin in the third quarter was 50 basis points lower than last year as inventory costs continue to catch up with the current market prices.Lastly, on capital deployment, we executed one share repurchase transaction during the quarter and another after the quarter deploying nearly $300 million of capital to retire 10 million shares.As part of our Investor Day event, we released 5-year financial targets and provided additional details on the growth, profitability and cash flow initiatives we have in place to continue operating this business with success while driving shareholder value.As Steve mentioned earlier, we have deployed $770 million of capital for share repurchases so far this year, and we’ll continue to evaluate share repurchases as opportunities arise.

	<p style='text-align:left;margin:0px;'>Looking forward, we anticipate realized steel prices to decrease further in the fourth quarter, reflecting lower industrial contract prices in Mexico and lower realized steel prices in Brazil.Adjusted EBITDA in the first nine months of the year were $2.1 billion, decreasing from $3.1 billion in the same period of last year, mainly as a result of lower steel prices, partially offset by lower costs.

In the third quarter, the sequential decrease was mainly the result of the lower steel price in Mexico, with a negative trend in benchmark steel prices, which was partially offset by higher industry cost contract prices.Moving to steel price, consolidated steel revenue per ton in the third quarter was down sequentially by $74 and decreased year-over-year by close to $160 per ton.

Moving on to net results, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per ADS decreased sequentially to $323 million and $1.38 respectively, reflecting the decrease in operating results and lower deferred tax results.

On the chart at the top, the main reason behind the decrease in adjusted EBITDA was a decrease in realized steel prices and higher costs, partially offset by higher shipments, as the consolidation of Usiminas did not significantly adjust the EBITDA in this quarter.As you can see in the chart at the top, adjusted EBITDA reached $698 million in the third quarter, up 2% versus the same period of last year, and down 22% versus the second quarter.

Looking forward, we expect adjusted EBITDA to decrease in the fourth quarter due to a decrease in operating margin, partially offset by slightly higher steel shipments.Shipments were up 5% sequentially and 24% versus the prior year third quarter, supportive of sustained market demand and an ease of some logistic constraints affecting our performance in the second quarter.This lengthy investment process, together with a deteriorating steel pricing environment, have certainly cut their toll on Usiminas' profitability in the third quarter and we will not see a significant improvement until early next year, when the new facilities are ramped up.
