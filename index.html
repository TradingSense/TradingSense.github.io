In the early part of the pandemic, the lodging sector saw delinquencies surge to a 20% rate of the unpaid principal balance of property loans, while office loans were stable with delinquencies of less than 3%.
Still, office loans were largely underwritten at some of the lowest interest rates of the past decade.

Analyst Paul Cheng said his sum-of-the-parts analysis shows CVR (CVI) ranking as relatively expensive compared to other refiners, and the company's light sweet crude slate also is disadvantaged compared to peers in the near term given the current very wide WCS discount.
Cheng cut APA Corp. (NASDAQ:APA) to Sector Perform from Sector Outperform with a $37 PT, cut from $43, expecting the pending Callon Petroleum acquisition will continue to weigh on the stock's near term performance.
In addition to the normal risk-arb pressure, Cheng thinks the stock could see further selling pressure after the deal closes, as Callon's existing shareholders may decide to exit the shares given the two companies' drastically different profiles.
With no end in sight to the Middle East conflict, the analyst also said APA (APA) will continue to be penalized in the near term for the association in Egypt.</p></td>

However, that suggests a pause in the first half of the year before a higher second half, BofA analysts said.
“The SPX can struggle in early Year 4 given lackluster January through May returns in presidential election years,” they said in the report.
In addition, the S&P 500 (SP500) was up 24.2% in 2023 after dropping 19.4% in 2022.
Because of this, analysts expect the S&P 500 (SP500) to be in the 5300-5400 range by the end of 2024.</p></td>

Justices refused to consider Apple’s AAPL, -1.43% appeal in the case challenging its lucrative App Store, a decision that will likely affect revenue from its App Store, which currently amounts to billions of dollars.
The high court also passed on Epic’s appeal of a lower court’s ruling that Apple’s App Store policies can limit how software is distributed and paid for.
U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in 2021 rejected Epic’s antitrust claims against Apple.

With E&P companies continuing to emphasize capital discipline more than production growth, drilling and frac activity and pricing likely will be lower in 2024 than 2023, while "energy service business momentum favors international and offshore as U.S. growth stalls," analyst Kurt Hallead wrote.
Benchmark also downgraded Nabors Industries (NBR), Patterson-UTI Energy (PTEN), ProPetro (PUMP) and Cactus (WHD) to Hold, while also slightly reducing stock PTs on Baker Hughes (BKR), Halliburton (HAL), Transocean (RIG) and SLB (SLB).
Expecting companies with greater relative exposure to international, offshore and Canada will outperform U.S. land drilling and frac services, Hallead's best ideas heading into 2024 are TechnipFMC (FTI), Weatherford (WFRD), SLB (SLB), Noble Corp. (NE) and Precision Drilling (PDS).

Turning to the energy sector, continued hostile action in the Middle East, particularly around the Red Sea and the Suez Canal, could lead to oil price volatility, according to the Oppenheimer report.
Overall, Oppenheimer suggested intermediate and long-term investors should stay the course rather than focus on the latest quarterly reports.

The first of those tests comes Wednesday, when a federal judge will hear oral arguments in a lawsuit between Coinbase and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The SEC last year sued Coinbase for allegedly operating an unregistered securities exchange.

The company is working with naval authorities in the U.S. and Middle East to move its cargoes through the region, Wirth said during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
The Wall Street Journal reported earlier that Shell (SHEL) had suspended all shipments through the Red Sea indefinitely after recent U.S. and U.K. strikes on the Houthis raised fears of an escalated conflict.
U.S. forces hit four Houthi missile sites in Yemen in a pre-emptive strike on Monday, after two commercial ships in the Red Sea were struck by missiles in the space of 24 hours.

Combs sued Diageo last May, saying the company didn’t make promised investments in both Ciroc and DeLeon, and treated them as inferior urban products.
The allegation made was that the situation worsened after Diageo (DEO) bought competing tequila brands Don Julio in 2014 and Casamigos in 2017.

They discovered that workers with strong longevity literacy are typically more confident they’ll have enough money to live comfortably in retirement than those with weak longevity literacy.
Lousy longevity literacy Boomers were only barely more longevity literate than members of Gen X, Gen Y and Gen Z and none of the generations demonstrated especially high longevity literacy; just 13% of boomers had strong longevity literacy compared with 12% of Gen Y, 11% of Gen X and 10% of Gen Z.

The company also said Monday it will cut production at its Ravensthorpe nickel mine in Australia, citing the significant downturn in nickel prices, which have dropped more than 40% in the past year due to high supplies and low demand for the metal.</p></td>

(HTGC)By: Max Gottlich, SA News Editor Hercules Capital (NYSE:HTGC) stock retreated 3.2% in Tuesday afternoon trading after Compass Point analyst Casey Alexander downgraded the business development company to Neutral on the view that peak valuation has been achieved, and thus, limiting further upside potential.
The stock is trading at a price-to-net-asset-value multiple of 1.61x, Alexander pointed out in a note.
The venture capital down cycle "still has more time to run and therefore we cannot yet project a peak P/NAV multiple of 1.6x for HTGC's forward valuation," the note added.
Alexander's Neutral rating disagrees with the SA Quant system rating of Strong Buy and the average sell-side analyst rating of Buy.

The company is working with naval authorities in the U.S. and Middle East to move its cargoes through the region, Wirth said during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
The Wall Street Journal reported earlier that Shell (SHEL) had suspended all shipments through the Red Sea indefinitely after recent U.S. and U.K. strikes on the Houthis raised fears of an escalated conflict.
U.S. forces hit four Houthi missile sites in Yemen in a pre-emptive strike on Monday, after two commercial ships in the Red Sea were struck by missiles in the space of 24 hours.
