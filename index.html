Stifel said that 2024 has been “effectively branded as an execution year” for the company, with a data readout not due until 2025.
The investment bank said it believes the company’s prime editing technology may face greater scrutiny because it is more nascent than CRISPR/Cas9.
It added that investor response to the readout could be “muted” if the trial is comparatively small.

Deutsche Bank analysts said the decline in corporate mentions may mean the froth is beginning to dissipate as companies turn their focus onto "real-world uses" of AI, rather than "pie-in-the-sky applications."
"Implementation will take time but it is likely eventually to be very widely deployed and ingrained in workflows," said Deutsche Bank analysts.
While social media enables the mass distribution of information, generative AI enables the mass generation of content by anyone with a laptop.

Cheng cut APA Corp. (NASDAQ:APA) to Sector Perform from Sector Outperform with a $37 PT, cut from $43, expecting the pending Callon Petroleum acquisition will continue to weigh on the stock's near term performance.
In addition to the normal risk-arb pressure, Cheng thinks the stock could see further selling pressure after the deal closes, as Callon's existing shareholders may decide to exit the shares given the two companies' drastically different profiles.
With no end in sight to the Middle East conflict, the analyst also said APA (APA) will continue to be penalized in the near term for the association in Egypt.

With E&P companies continuing to emphasize capital discipline more than production growth, drilling and frac activity and pricing likely will be lower in 2024 than 2023, while "energy service business momentum favors international and offshore as U.S. growth stalls," analyst Kurt Hallead wrote.
Benchmark also downgraded Nabors Industries (NBR), Patterson-UTI Energy (PTEN), ProPetro (PUMP) and Cactus (WHD) to Hold, while also slightly reducing stock PTs on Baker Hughes (BKR), Halliburton (HAL), Transocean (RIG) and SLB (SLB).
Expecting companies with greater relative exposure to international, offshore and Canada will outperform U.S. land drilling and frac services, Hallead's best ideas heading into 2024 are TechnipFMC (FTI), Weatherford (WFRD), SLB (SLB), Noble Corp. (NE) and Precision Drilling (PDS).

Turning to the energy sector, continued hostile action in the Middle East, particularly around the Red Sea and the Suez Canal, could lead to oil price volatility, according to the Oppenheimer report.
Overall, Oppenheimer suggested intermediate and long-term investors should stay the course rather than focus on the latest quarterly reports.

The company is working with naval authorities in the U.S. and Middle East to move its cargoes through the region, Wirth said during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
The Wall Street Journal reported earlier that Shell (SHEL) had suspended all shipments through the Red Sea indefinitely after recent U.S. and U.K. strikes on the Houthis raised fears of an escalated conflict.
U.S. forces hit four Houthi missile sites in Yemen in a pre-emptive strike on Monday, after two commercial ships in the Red Sea were struck by missiles in the space of 24 hours.

Going forward, Diageo (DEO) and Combs have no ongoing business relationship, either with respect to Cîroc vodka or DeLeón tequila, which Diageo (DEO) now solely owns.
Combs sued Diageo last May, saying the company didn’t make promised investments in both Ciroc and DeLeon, and treated them as inferior urban products.
The allegation made was that the situation worsened after Diageo (DEO) bought competing tequila brands Don Julio in 2014 and Casamigos in 2017.

They discovered that workers with strong longevity literacy are typically more confident they’ll have enough money to live comfortably in retirement than those with weak longevity literacy.
Lousy longevity literacy Boomers were only barely more longevity literate than members of Gen X, Gen Y and Gen Z and none of the generations demonstrated especially high longevity literacy; just 13% of boomers had strong longevity literacy compared with 12% of Gen Y, 11% of Gen X and 10% of Gen Z.

Planned capital programs have been reduced or re-phased by ~$400M in 2024 and $250M in 2025, reflecting the halt in capital spending at Cobre Panama and proactive initiatives to offset capital inflation in the Zambian business, the company said.
First Quantum (OTCPK:FQVLF) said it will reduce headcount at Cobre Panama to fewer than 1,000 workers from ~1,400, depending on environmental stewardship programs.
The company also said Monday it will cut production at its Ravensthorpe nickel mine in Australia, citing the significant downturn in nickel prices, which have dropped more than 40% in the past year due to high supplies and low demand for the metal.</p></td>
