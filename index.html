(PRME) StockBy: Val Brickates Kennedy, SA News Editor Stifel has downgraded Prime Medicine (NASDAQ:PRME) to hold, citing a “relatively quieter” catalyst outlook for 2024 and concerns over finances.
Stifel said that 2024 has been “effectively branded as an execution year” for the company, with a data readout not due until 2025.
The investment bank said it believes the company’s prime editing technology may face greater scrutiny because it is more nascent than CRISPR/Cas9.
It added that investor response to the readout could be “muted” if the trial is comparatively small.

Deutsche Bank analysts said the decline in corporate mentions may mean the froth is beginning to dissipate as companies turn their focus onto "real-world uses" of AI, rather than "pie-in-the-sky applications."
"Implementation will take time but it is likely eventually to be very widely deployed and ingrained in workflows," said Deutsche Bank analysts.
While social media enables the mass distribution of information, generative AI enables the mass generation of content by anyone with a laptop.

Cheng cut APA Corp. (NASDAQ:APA) to Sector Perform from Sector Outperform with a $37 PT, cut from $43, expecting the pending Callon Petroleum acquisition will continue to weigh on the stock's near term performance.
In addition to the normal risk-arb pressure, Cheng thinks the stock could see further selling pressure after the deal closes, as Callon's existing shareholders may decide to exit the shares given the two companies' drastically different profiles.
With no end in sight to the Middle East conflict, the analyst also said APA (APA) will continue to be penalized in the near term for the association in Egypt.

However, that suggests a pause in the first half of the year before a higher second half, BofA analysts said.

With E&P companies continuing to emphasize capital discipline more than production growth, drilling and frac activity and pricing likely will be lower in 2024 than 2023, while "energy service business momentum favors international and offshore as U.S. growth stalls," analyst Kurt Hallead wrote.
Benchmark also downgraded Nabors Industries (NBR), Patterson-UTI Energy (PTEN), ProPetro (PUMP) and Cactus (WHD) to Hold, while also slightly reducing stock PTs on Baker Hughes (BKR), Halliburton (HAL), Transocean (RIG) and SLB (SLB).
Expecting companies with greater relative exposure to international, offshore and Canada will outperform U.S. land drilling and frac services, Hallead's best ideas heading into 2024 are TechnipFMC (FTI), Weatherford (WFRD), SLB (SLB), Noble Corp. (NE) and Precision Drilling (PDS).

U.S. forces hit four Houthi missile sites in Yemen in a pre-emptive strike on Monday, after two commercial ships in the Red Sea were struck by missiles in the space of 24 hours.
